# The global gradient-based groundwater model framework G³M
The global gradient-based groundwater model framework G³M-f is an extesible model framework that is the basis for the G³M coupled to the global hydrologic model WaterGAP (http://watergap.de/).

While it is intended to be used as a in memory coupled model it is also capable of running a standard standalone groundwater model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
libboost >= 1.56
OpenMP
libGMP
Gtest
```

### Installing

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## Running a simple model
```
Give the example
```
## Deployment in other models

## Running the tests

Automated tests consits of gunit test which are compiled automatically with the attached cmake file.
You can run them by executing the test executable.

```
runUnitTests
```
