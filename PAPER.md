# Summary

The global gradient-based groundwater model framework G続M-f is an extesible model framework that is the basis for the global groundwater mode G続M.
In order to represent groundwater-surface water interactions as well as the impact of capillary rise on evapotranspiration in global-scale hydrological models, it is necessary to simulate the location and temporal variation of the groundwater table.
This requires replacing simulation of groundwater dynamics using groundwater storage variations in individual grid cells (independent from the storage variation in neighbouring cells) with hydraulic head gradient-based groundwater modelling.
G続M is a newly developed gradient-based groundwater model which adapts MODFLOW [@harbaugh2005modflow] principles for the globalscale.
It is written in C++ and intended to be coupled to the global hydraulic model WaterGAP (http://watergap.de) [@alcamo2003development;@doll2003global;@doll2012impact;@doell2014global;@muller2014sensitivity], but can also be used for regional groundwater models and coupling to other hydraulic models.
While it is intended to be used as a in memory coupled model it is also capable of running a standard standalone groundwater model.
